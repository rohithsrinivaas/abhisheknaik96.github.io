## [Projects](#projects)

**Automatic Waste Segregator; Centre For Innovation, IIT Madras (Sep 2017 - Feb 2018)**

- Worked on Computer Vision algorithms and Deep learning models for classification of waste.
- Achieved accuracy of 88% and 92% respectively by transfer learning over Inception V3 and Inception-V2-resnet.
- Selected for the international finals of Hult Social Entrepreneurship prize and was featured in [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/this-smart-bin-is-poised-to-help-solve-the-global-issue-of-waste-management/articleshow/61616385.cms)

**Hand Gesture Control of Robots; Centre For Innovation, IIT Madras (Sep 2017 - Nov 2017)**
- Implemented Computer Vision algorithms and Deep learning models for detecting feature locations on egocentric
hands images.
- Finetuned YOLO for hand detection and cascaded a bounding box regressor on top of it to extract features
(finger tips). Established dynamic control of an omnidirectional wheel driven robot using serial communication.
- Displayed the project in Centre for Innovation -OpenHouse with 5 other computer vision projects.

**2D Body-Fitted Grid Generation; Guide:Prof: Sreenivas Jayanti, IIT Madras (Feb 2019 - May 2019)**
- Worked on Transfinite Interpolation and solving Winslow PDEs using TDMA algorithm for semi-elliptic domain.
- Implemented Mesh Quality Quantification by computing Orthogonality and Cell Quality Metrics.
- Generalised the code for any 2D domain which can be integrated with any CFD solver

**Nano-Calphad for Lead-free solder systems- Guide: Prof: K. C. Hari Kumar, IIT Madras (Dec 2017- Mar 2018)**
- Modelling the surface energy contribution at nanoscale for lead-free solder systems.
- Calculated the surface energy for line-compounds in nanoscale using Density Functional Theory (DFT).
- Using OpenCalphad and Fortran to write customised subroutines to compute excess nano-Gibbs energy
