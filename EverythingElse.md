# [Interests and Hobbies](#everythingElse)

### Painting
Painting is one of the art forms that requires both merge of imagination and focus. It has been my favourite thing-to-do since school days which later encouraged me to participate in competitions. I am currently exploring pencil sketching as a hobby. 

### Badminton
Badminton is officially the worldâ€™s fastest racqet sport, which requires quick reflexes and superb conditioning. It is also one of the sports which puts intense demands on your lungs and heart which makes it an excellent for cardiovascular health. I am only a beginner but hope to become better in the future.

### Tamil
Tamil being my mother tongue had a great influence in me due to vast literature. I still continue to read books like Ponniyin Selvan for my thrist for Tamil literature. Hope to become proficient in Tamil to level when I can start writing books in the Tamil Language.

### Books
If I had to pick one ~~thing~~ of the few things (Painting comes first) I could do all my life, it would be reading. I was have a set of books in my Google Drive, which makes to feel hours gone by as seconds!!
