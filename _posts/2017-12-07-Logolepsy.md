Hello, world. <br>

Not long ago, Nike the torpe succumbed to throes of love. Left for dead, he became engulfed in drapetomania, which led to a phase wherein all he wanted to achieve was being unfuckwithable. A plethora of things needing overhaul were identified, and soon gymming and lisztomania took over. But though he spent days and weeks induratizing, it wasn’t long before he longed for the elusive redamancy yet again. Fate led him to this amazing librocubicularist, who unveiled a window to a world he never knew existed. Idiosyncrasies like vellichor brought them closer and things like life pulled them apart. The scripturient demisexual was inundated by the vorfreude he seeked solace in - savouring the roar of waves and the soft sirimiri while cafuning in front of a warm hearth, following the satiation of the basorexia. And thus the newfound logolepsy<sup>^</sup> was put to test.
