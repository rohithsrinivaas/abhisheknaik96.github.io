summary : A collection of AI advances, as and when they come along.

Hello, world. <br>

Here's where I'll collect some of the AI advances that catch my eye. As you'll notice, the main focus will be on advances of Reinforcement Learning in the self-driving space.    

There's a large bunch of items that I've to add to this list from the scatter of places I've collected them (mainly through [my tweets](https://twitter.com/anaik96), after being momentarily blown away on hearing/reading about it for the first time).   

In case you find anything fascinating, feel free to ping me for some interesting discussions.

- 17/3/2018 : [ApolloScape : (Apparently) World’s largest open-source dataset for autonomous driving](https://medium.com/@Synced/baidu-apollo-releases-massive-self-driving-dataset-teams-up-with-berkeley-deepdrive-5e785ab4053b)
	Baidu's Apollo just released this massive dataset which is 10 times larger than other open-source datasets like Kitti and CityScapes, and can be used for perception, simulation scenes, road networks etc., as well as enabling autonomous driving vehicles to be trained in more complex environments, weather and traffic conditions. Oh, and in partnerships with [Berkeley DeepDrive](https://deepdrive.berkeley.edu).	 

- 26/1/2018 : [PsychLab : A Psychology Laboratory for DRL Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.08116.pdf)    
	DeepMind just released this new framework that allows DRL agents and humans to be directly compared to one another on tasks lifted directly from cognitive psychology and visual psychophysics (though from an initial glance, those seen as DL tasks rather than RL ones). They also study of the visual psychophysics of [the UNREAL agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05397) (that's why) and try to use it for possibly improving the agent's performance.    
	For instance, an input preprocessing step that expands the center of the observation - inspired by foveal vision - improved performance on all eight available 'laser tag' level, where the important objects tend to be at the center of gaze. This demonstrates how probing the details of agent behavior with Psychlab can feed directly back into DRL research to yield new ideas for improving agent performance. Interesting...

- 21/1/2018 : [GPUs now available on Colaboratory!](https://www.kaggle.com/getting-started/47096#post271139)    
	This is unbelievable. Google is letting people use GPUs in Colaboratory! K80s for now, TPUs next? Let's see how long this last before folks (especially miners) exploit the crap out of this...   

- 12/1/2018 : [Mobileye's Responsibility Sensitive Safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ_uGvHlLr4)    
	Mobileye finally has a product out of [its remarkable paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03295) on safety for autonomous vehicles. This RSS module can do things like calculate the minimum safe distance to cut into a lane based on the speeds of the vehicles involved, etc. It would be interesting to try out this RSS module in some of the FAD research.    

- 9/1/2018 : [MuJoCo plug-in for Unity](http://www.mujoco.org/book/unity.html)   
	MuJoCo physics + Unity graphics = Awesome robotic simulators!

- 8/1/2018 : [NVIDIA's AutoSIM VR simulator](https://www.vrfocus.com/2018/01/nvidia-aids-the-development-of-self-driving-cars-with-the-autosim-vr-simulator/)   
	Yet another driving simulator, this time from NVIDIA. Seems to be highly customizable - 'moving the sun to test a self-driving car's sensors with shadows or direct glare off the road'.

- 19/12/2017 : [Intel AI's RL Coach](https://ai.intel.com/reinforcement-learning-coach-carla-qr-dqn/)   
	Is now equipped with basic imitation learning algorithms, CARLA, and new algorithms like QR-DQN.

- 20/11/2017 : A bunch of new announcements!    
	1. [GTA-V](https://github.com/ai-tor/DeepGTAV) Dev is out!   
	2. [Microsoft AirSim for Cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnz1X3UNM5Y) is out! 
	3. [CARLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp8Dz-Zek2E) for Linux is also out!    
	    
	Exciting times ahead for autonomous driving researcher! :D
