# About Me

Hello World! I am a final year undergraduate student at IIT Madras, pursuing a Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](www.cse.iitm.ac.in) at [IIT Madras](www.iitm.ac.in). I am interested in tackling challenging and practical problems in the broad areas of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning, under the guidance of [Professor Balaraman Ravindran](www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi).

# Projects

Here are some selected projects I have done over the course of my undergraduate studies.

## Driving in Traffic with Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Jan 2017 – May 2017

Used a Deep Learning model to detect and predict features from the on-board dashcam of a car, and trained a Reinforcement Learning model to make driving decisions to successfully drive in traffic.

## Finding the Salient Object in a Visual Scene 
- Jan 2017 – May 2017

Implemented Boolean Map Saliency for fast detection of the salient objects in a scene. Consistently matched the performances of Deep Learning techniques over various metrics.

## An AI smarter than an 8th Grader
- Aug 2016 – Nov 2016

Built a question-answering system for 8th-grade multiple-choice science questions, which demonstrated a reasonable level of logical reasoning.

## Light Field Photography
- Aug 2016 – Nov 2016

Captured the 4D light field from a scene and implemented features like refocusing after the photograph has been taken, looking 'behind' objects. Also developed an interactive GUI for the same. 

## Vehicle Counter and Segregator

Built a prototype for the institute gate using Computer Vision techniques to categorize and keep and count of the flowing traffic in dynamic lighting conditions. 


# Work Experience

## Intel Labs
**Research Internship; May 2017 – Jul 2017; Bengaluru, India**

- Developed a multi-agent version of the driving simulator TORCS and integrated it with Gym, OpenAI’s RL toolkit.
- Proposed and implemented a novel risk-averse imitation learning algorithm, achieving 22 to 89% improvement
over the state-of-the-art in terms of tail-end risk at several physics-based control tasks.
- This Deep Reinforcement Learning project is under review as a conference paper.

## Purdue University
**Research Internship; May 2016 – Jul 2016; Indiana, USA**

- Modeled and empirically observed a bi-modal distribution of user-lifespan in a social network.
- Engineered temporal features from the ‘comment’ interactions to design a binary probabilistic classifier to categorise the expected lifespan of new users based on their initial activity.
- Created and curated one of the richest social-media datasets and released it for public use.

## Amazon Development Centre
**Technical Internship; May 2015 – Jul 2015; Chennai, India**

- Worked on the design and implementation of a machine learning classifier to determine the relevance of a text-block with a bunch of other text-blocks, in a book.
- The project, now in production, helps Kindle users to directly start reading a book after downloading it, without having to flip through a lot of irrelevant pages.


# Teaching Experience
## Principles of Machine Learning (CS4011)
**Aug 2017 - Present; Dept. of CSE, IIT Madras** 
As one of Teaching Assistants of this course taken by [Professor Balaraman Ravindran](www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi) and [Professor Mitesh Khapra](www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk).


# Interests and Hobbies

## Sports

### Football
I love watching and playing _the beautiful game_. Come rain or shine, my heart beats for Real Madrid. I also root for Portugal, Germany, and Brazil. My idol is, you guessed it, Cristiano Ronaldo - one of the greatest footballers of all time, both on and off the field.

### Formula 1
There's hardly anything as spectacular as this confluence of science and engineering which gives the world these lean, mean, and beautiful machines, with some of fittest athletes on the planet battling fearlessly at speeds excessive of 300 kmph over 20 exotic locations. _Forza Ferrari!_  

## Music

Beats. Bass. Boisterous. Be it working or working out, EDM is my constant companion. Alan Walker, Fall Out Boy, Green Day, Imagine Dragons, Linkin Park, The Script, Zedd rule my playlist of this renowned bathroom singer. I also tune into old classics once in a while. I wish to make my own remixes someday. 

## Age of Empires

I grew up building civilisations and plotting the downfall of various others, all the while learning about so much intriguing, medieval history. With countless hours spent on this gripping storyline, exciting gameplay, and its insane popularity, I can't wait for [AOE4](https://www.ageofempires.com/games/age-of-empires-iv/) to come out!

## Travelling and Photography

I love visiting and documenting quaint, spectacular places, meeting local people, digging into the native cuisine. You can find some of my photos [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/120844874@N04/). I also love trekking and hiking into the wilderness. After Skydiving, Scuba diving, and Parasailing, I'm looking forward to Hang gliding and Bungee jumping!
